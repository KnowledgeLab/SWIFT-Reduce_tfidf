Doctor Armstrong uses New York City as an example in his thoughtful paper. What he says of school hygiene there will be found to apply with equal, if not greater, force elsewhere. There is always the danger that in the pressure of routine duties the larger objects are apt to be lost sight of. Doctor Armstrong's excellent analysis should make us pause and take stock of the broader views of the whole question of School Hygiene.
Doctor Billings discusses in this paper some of the subjects which must always be taken into consideration in controlling the communicable disease situation in any community-among these are the following: Registration, Recognition, Termination, Hospitalization, School Exclusion, Disinfection-and the Education and Instruction of Profession and Public.
Unemployment and under employment are topics that the average health officer pays little attention to. No one will deny the significance of unemployment when considered solely from the public health point of view. Men and women who are out of work or who are only working part time necessarily are unable to buy proper food and shelter which are so essential for their physical well being. Mr. McCrudden, in this paper, tells in an interesting manner how a number of unemployed men were given work through the Health Department of the City of Philadelphia. Not only did they benefit themselves but the work they did was a direct benefit to the entire community. This is a subject that health officials generally might well give more attention to.
